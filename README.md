# Snake-Game-Using-Python
This is a Classic Snake game. The player controls a snake that moves around a grid and eats food to grow longer. The player must avoid crashing into the edges of the grid or the snake's own body. The goal is to get the highest score by eating as much food as possible without crashing.
